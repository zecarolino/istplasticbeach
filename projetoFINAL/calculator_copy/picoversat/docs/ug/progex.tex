\section{Assembler}
\label{sec:progex}

PicoVersat can be programmed in its assembly language. The assembler is a Python
program called {\tt va}. It can be used to create the boot ROM program or the user program.

The assembler reads a dictionary (json format) named xdict.txt, which associates
user friendly names with numeric constants.

The dictionary xdict.txt is produced by running the xdict.v Verilog file in a
simulator. The xdict.v file contains a testbench-like module and includes a few header
files where the constants of interest are defined.
