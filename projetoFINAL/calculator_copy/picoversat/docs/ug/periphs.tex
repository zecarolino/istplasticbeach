\section{Peripherals}
\label{sec:periphs}

PicoVersat is supplied with two useful peripherals, a general purpose register
file and a debug print facility.

A simple System on Chip
(SoC) including picoVersat, a program and data memory, and the two peripherals
attached to the data bus is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:periphs}.

Refer to the memory map in section~\ref{sec:mem_map} to check the base addresses
of the peripherals.

\subsection{General Purpose Register File}

This peripheral contains a 16x32bit register file that can be used by user
programs. 

\subsection{Debug Printer}

This peripheral can be used by user programs to print characters, mainly for
debug purposes.
