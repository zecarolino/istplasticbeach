\section{Introduction}

PicoVersat is a minimal hardware controller. It is designed for simple control
tasks where normally finite state machines are employed. Being a programmable
solution, the risk of hardware design errors is mitigated and the design of
complex control structures is simplified.

PicoVersat features a minimal instruction set and is not designed for high
performance computing. However, it can effectively implement simple algorithms
and perform simple calculations. PicoVersat has a program memory interface and a
memory mapped data interface, only.
